# Security Policy

## 🔒 Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | ✅ Yes             |
| < 1.0   | ❌ No              |

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

### Image Processing Safety
- **File validation**: Only processes supported image formats
- **Memory limits**: Large images may consume significant memory
- **File permissions**: Respects system file permissions
- **Input validation**: Validates file paths and user inputs

### Data Privacy
- **Local processing**: All image processing happens locally on your machine
- **No data transmission**: Images are never sent to external servers
- **Metadata handling**: EXIF data is processed but not logged or transmitted
- **Temporary files**: No temporary files are created outside the project directory

### Known Limitations
- **Memory usage**: Very large images (>100MB) may cause memory issues
- **File overwrites**: The tool can overwrite files in the output directory
- **Path traversal**: Input validation prevents directory traversal attacks
- **Malformed images**: Malicious image files are handled safely by Pillow library

## 🚨 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### For Security Issues:
**Do NOT create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by:

1. **Email** (preferred): Send details to `engineering@mamiteam.com`
2. **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. **Direct contact**: Contact maintainers directly through GitHub

### What to Include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if available)
- Your contact information

### Response Timeline:
- **24-48 hours**: Initial acknowledgment
- **1 week**: Initial assessment and response
- **2-4 weeks**: Fix development and testing
- **Coordinated disclosure**: Public disclosure after fix is available

## 🛠️ Security Best Practices

### For Users:
- **Keep updated**: Always use the latest version
- **Trusted sources**: Only download from official repositories
- **File verification**: Be cautious with images from untrusted sources
- **Backup originals**: Keep backups of important images
- **Review changes**: Check output files before deleting originals

### For Contributors:
- **Input validation**: Always validate user inputs
- **Error handling**: Handle errors gracefully without exposing system info
- **Dependencies**: Keep Pillow and other dependencies updated
- **Code review**: All code changes require review
- **Testing**: Include security considerations in testing

## 🔍 Security Audits

### Regular Checks:
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Code security review
- Input validation testing
- Error handling verification

### Tools Used:
- **Dependabot**: Automated dependency updates
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Vulnerability notifications
- **Bandit**: Python security linter (planned)
- **Safety**: Dependency vulnerability checker (planned)

## 📋 Security Checklist for Releases

Before each release:
- [ ] Dependencies updated and scanned for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Input validation reviewed
- [ ] Error messages don't expose sensitive information
- [ ] File permissions and paths properly handled
- [ ] Memory usage tested with large files

## 🤝 Responsible Disclosure

We believe in responsible disclosure and will:
- Acknowledge security reports promptly
- Work with researchers to understand and fix issues
- Credit reporters (unless they prefer anonymity)
- Provide updates on fix progress
- Coordinate public disclosure timing
